I am based in The Hague, but was originally born in the U.S.A. I attended the European school of the Hague, and have graduated with a European baccalaureate. The Dutch here consider me a an international student, and the internationals consider me a true dutchman. One of my biggest strengths is being able to work affectively for and with people from different cultural backgrounds. My occupations consist of graphic design, music production and playing in a youth orchestra. I play weekly with the Hornets rugby club in The Hague, a student rugby club where I can stay fit and challenge myself mentally.
